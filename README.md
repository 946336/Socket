# Socket
A small C++ wrapper around UNIX sockets

<samp>send</samp> and <samp>recv</samp> are sample programs to demonstrate the intended use of the <samp>Socket</samp> class.

Heavy reference to Beej's guide to UNIX sockets at http://beej.us/guide/bgipc/output/html/multipage/unixsock.html. It is assumed that the user has perused and somewhat understands Beej's guide.

Disclaimer: It is also assumed (for better or for worse) that I have somewhat understood Beej's guide.
